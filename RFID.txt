# RFID - AUTHENTICATION, ACCESS CONTROL, VALUE & DATA BLOCK
# 
#
# Check the command for read write of the RFID
Authenticate sector with key A or Key B
________________________
BASIC OPERATION COMMANDS
------------------------
-> Read
-> Write
-> Increment (2 step operation - Increment and transfer)
-> Decrement (2 step operation - Increment and transfer)
-> Restore / Transfer

Prior to command execution, the sector and block for data access should be
authenticated either with Key A or key B. Hence the need for authentication
command.


__________
DATA BLOCK
----------
consist of 16 bits of data
0-3 (first 4 bytes) 	stores the data
4-7 (second 4 bytes) 	stores the complement of data in byte 0-3
8-11 (third 4 bytes)	stores a duplicate of the data in byte 0-3
byte-12 		stores the address where data in byte 0-11 are stored
byte-13			stores the complement of address stored in byte-12
byte-14			stores the duplicate of address stored in byte-12
byte-15			stores the duplicate of addr complement in byte-13
